    " The modern shipping industry standardized a set of container sizes, so no matter what item is shipped, the container size remains the same. Standardization significantly improves shipping efficiency. Logistics staff select container transport options such as ships, planes, trains, and trucks, based on the container’s size and the client’s delivery needs. *Digital container technology is similar*.\n",

    "Containers solve the problem of making software portable so that applications can run on multiple platforms. A container, powered by the containerization engine, is a standard unit of software that encapsulates the application code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings necessary for programmers to build, ship, and run applications efficiently. Operations and underlying infrastructure issues are no longer blockers. You can quickly move applications from your laptop to a testing environment, from a staging environment to a production environment, from a physical machine to a virtual machine, or a private cloud or public cloud, and always know that your application will work correctly. A container can be small, just tens of megabytes, and developers can almost instantly start containerized applications."
